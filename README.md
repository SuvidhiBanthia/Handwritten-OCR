# Handwritten Optical Character Recognition 
This Mini project was completed as part of the Deep Learning Lab at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal.
It consists of a Deep Learning OCR model that can work with cursive handwritten data to convert it into digital text. Three architectures have been implemented to achieve this and their results compared: 
* CNN+LSTM (Convolutional Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory units)
* CNN+GRU (Convolutional Neural Networks with Gated Recurrent Units)
* CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network)
The model is then deployed using the Flask framework.

Refer to the Project report for more details about the project.
